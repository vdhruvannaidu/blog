Hey, thanks for landing on this page and checking out a more extensive version of my humble-brag page ðŸ˜„

# Why

This corner of the internet helps me clarify and improve my own thinking. Its a mechanism to cope with my chaotic brain that constantly comes up with thoughts or comprehensions of the world concepts but sometimes has conflicts or struggles to structure and organize them.

I believe writing is a superpower that most people are yet to discover, because its mainly a path to understanding yourself and sense-making of a rapidly changing world we live in.

# Who
I currently work as a software developer at a tech company. In my free time I am also learning new technologies, design and writing weekly about TypeScript | JavaScript | Web 3/Blockchain | Cryptography.

My passion is never-ending search for knowledge, learning and leading an examined life. This websites serves as my playground for for experimenting with ideas, products, thoughts and figuring out how the world works.
